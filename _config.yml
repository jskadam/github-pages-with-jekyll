  Greetings people, greetings! Greetings and salutations! 
  What a beuatiful day to start writing on the internet.(Yes I am channeling George Constanza)
  
  I will just write few lines about TV shows for now.
  
  The Wire and Seinfeld are my all time favourite TV Shows.
  
  Some of my favourite qoutes from these series:
  
  Jerry: Are you reading my VCR manual?
  Kramer: Well, we canâ€™t all be reading the classics, Professor Highbrow. Seinfeld
  
  Lestor Freamon: A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? 
  It's the shit that happens when you're waiting for the things that never come. The Wire
